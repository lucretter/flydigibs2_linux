## 🛠️ Installation

### Install .deb Package (Debian/Ubuntu)

```bash
# Download the latest .deb package from Releases
wget https://github.com/lucretter/flydigibs2_linux/releases/latest/download/bs2pro-controller.deb

# Install the package
sudo dpkg -i bs2pro-controller.deb

# Install dependencies if needed
sudo apt-get install -f
```

### Install .rpm Package (Fedora/RHEL/CentOS)

```bash
# Download the latest .rpm package from Releases
wget https://github.com/lucretter/flydigibs2_linux/releases/latest/download/bs2pro-controller.rpm

### You can also install with the installation script

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lucretter/flydigibs2_linux.git
cd flydigibs2_linux
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

This will:

- Set up a Python virtual environment  
- Install dependencies  
- Build the executable  
- Install it to `/usr/bin/bs2pro_controller`  

## 🔐 First Run Setup - udev Rules Prompt

On first launch, the application will automatically detect your BS2PRO device and prompt you to install udev rules if necessary.

Udev rule is needed so the application can run without sudo.

### If the prompt doesn't appear or fails:

You can manually install udev rules:

```bash
# Find your device's vendor and product ID
lsusb

# Create udev rules (replace VENDOR_ID and PRODUCT_ID with your values)
echo 'SUBSYSTEM=="hidraw", ATTRS{idVendor}=="VENDOR_ID", ATTRS{idProduct}=="PRODUCT_ID", MODE="0666", GROUP="plugdev"
SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="VENDOR_ID", ATTRS{idProduct}=="PRODUCT_ID", MODE="0666", GROUP="plugdev"' | sudo tee /etc/udev/rules.d/99-bs2pro.rules

# Reload udev rules
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
sudo udevadm trigger

# Reconnect your BS2PRO device
```

## 🚀 Usage

### GUI Mode

```bash
bs2pro_controller
```

### CLI Mode

```bash
bs2pro_controller rpm_1900
bs2pro_controller autostart_instant

To view logs in real-time:

```bash
tail -f ~/.config/bs2pro_controller/bs2pro.log
```

## 🧪 Development Notes

- Designed for KDE/Linux but should be cross-platform compatible  
- CLI mode for scripting or automation
